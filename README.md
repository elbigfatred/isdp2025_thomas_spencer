# isdp2025_thomas_spencer
Project Repository for ISDP 2025

To Run:

1. Run MODIFIED 2025_Bullseye_DB2025_1.1.sql in your MySQL database. I used XAMPP to supply the database connection for my desktop application; which runs via localhost at Port 8080.

2. Backend and Frontend are two separate applications within the 'Application' folder; I've been running both at once using IntelliJ.

Documents, etc:

 - Journals: Contains weekly journals for ISDP
 - Database: Contains Data Dictionary, ERD, and SQL scripts.
 - Test Plants: Contains Sprint test plan(s) for IDSP.
 - Wireframes: Contains relevant, basic wireframes for front end side of the IMS.
